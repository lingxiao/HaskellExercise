0.8.3.0
=======

- odeSolve

- Matrix arithmetic automatically replicates matrix with single row/column

- latexFormat, dispcf

0.8.2.0
=======

- fromRows/fromColumns now automatically expand vectors of dim 1
  to match the common dimension.
  fromBlocks also replicates single row/column matrices.
  Previously all dimensions had to be exactly the same.

- display utilities: dispf, disps, vecdisp

- scalar

- minimizeV, minimizeVD, using Vector instead of lists.

0.8.1.0
=======

- runBenchmarks

0.8.0.0
=======

- singularValues, fullSVD, thinSVD, compactSVD, leftSV, rightSV
  and complete interface to [d|z]gesdd.
  Algorithms based on the SVD of large matrices can now be
  significantly faster.

- eigenvalues, eigenvaluesSH

- linearSolveLS, rq

0.7.2.0
=======

- ranksv

0.7.1.0
=======

- buildVector/buildMatrix

- removed NFData instances

0.6.0.0
=======

- added randomVector, gaussianSample, uniformSample, meanCov

- added rankSVD, nullspaceSVD

- rank, nullspacePrec, and economy svd defined in terms of ranksvd.

- economy svd now admits zero rank matrices and return a "degenerate
  rank 1" decomposition with zero singular value.

- added NFData instances for Matrix and Vector.

- liftVector, liftVector2 replaced by mapVector, zipVector.
