 A simple scientific library for Haskell
-----------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

Recommended method (ok in Ubuntu/Debian systems):
    $ sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev liblapack-dev
    $ cabal install hmatrix

Detailed installation instructions:

INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS ----------------------------------------

1) Install a recent ghc (e.g. ghc-6.10.3)

2) Install cabal-install. A binary for windows can be obtained from:

   http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-0.6.2/cabal.exe

   Put it somewhere in the path, for instance in c:\ghc\ghc-6.10.3\bin

3) Download and uncompress in a temporary location the following file:

   http://code.haskell.org/hmatrix/gsl-lapack-windows.zip

   It contains a folder, gsl, and four DLL's.

4) Move the gsl folder to C:\ghc\ghc-6.10.3\include

5) Move the four DLL's to C:\ghc\ghc-6.10.3\bin

6) Download and uncompress hmatrix-x.y.z.tar.gz from Hackage:

   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hmatrix

7) Edit hmatrix.cabal:

     line 17:      build-type:         Custom
     change to:    build-type:         Simple

     and at the end of the file add:

        extra-libraries: libgsl-0 blas lapack
        extra-lib-dirs: c:\ghc\ghc-6.10.3\bin

8) Open a terminal, cd to the hmatrix folder, and run

   > cabal install

9) If everything is ok we can run the tests:

   > runhaskell examples\tests.hs

NOTE: The examples using graphics do not yet work in windows.
